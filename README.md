We have made a new API that connects to our **HCF Core** for
all of the external plugin creators!

Have questions? Please feel free to join our [support discord](https://discord.helydev.com/) and
open a support ticket!

## API Usage
We have added many events, and will continue to add more!
If you need a specific event, and the API does not have the event, please join our [support discord](https://discord.helydev.com/)
